Internship Task 1 :- Guess the Number Game

A simple yet fun Java-based game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. The game includes multiple difficulty levels, limited attempts, and hints to make the experience more challenging and engaging.

Features

	•	Difficulty Levels:
	•	Easy: Guess a number between 1 and 50 with unlimited attempts.
	•	Medium: Guess a number between 1 and 100 with a maximum of 10 attempts.
	•	Hard: Guess a number between 1 and 500 with a maximum of 7 attempts.
	•	Hint System: After each guess, the program provides feedback (too high or too low) and narrows down the range of possible numbers.
	•	Maximum Attempts: The number of attempts is limited in Medium and Hard difficulty levels, adding more excitement and pressure.
	•	Replay Option: After each game, players can choose to play again or exit.

How to Play

	1.	Clone or download the repository.
	2.	Compile and run the Java program.
	3.	Select your difficulty level and start guessing the number!
	4.	Try to guess the number within the allowed attempts and range.

Technologies Used

	•	Java: Core logic and game functionality.


Internship Task 2 :- Rock Paper Scissors Game 

I successfully completed Task 2 of my InternPe Internship, where I developed a Rock Paper Scissors game using Java. This classic game is a simple yet engaging way to apply core programming concepts, like conditional statements, loops, and user interaction in Java.

Key Features:

	•	Player vs Computer Mode: The player can choose between rock, paper, or scissors, while the computer generates a random choice.
	•	Game Rules Implementation: The traditional rules of rock-paper-scissors are enforced, where:
	•	Rock crushes Scissors
	•	Scissors cuts Paper
	•	Paper covers Rock
	•	Interactive Gameplay: After each round, the game declares the result, keeping track of the player’s score against the computer.
	•	User Input Validation: Proper input validation ensures the user enters valid choices, preventing any crashes or unexpected behavior.
	•	Replay Option: After each round, the player has the option to replay or exit the game.

Technologies Used:

	•	Java: The game logic and user interface were built using Java, focusing on the core concepts of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).
	•	IDE: Developed using Eclipse/IntelliJ (whichever IDE you used).

Challenges & Learning:

	•	One of the key challenges was to ensure smooth user interaction while keeping the game simple and intuitive.
	•	I also focused on applying clean coding principles to make the code modular and easy to maintain.

How to Run the Project:

	1.	Download or clone the repository from GitHub.
	2.	Compile and run the Java code in your preferred IDE or using the command line.
	3.	Follow the prompts to play the game and enjoy!
